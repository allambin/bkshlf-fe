# BKSHLF Frontend

## Overview

This project is the **frontend** for the BKSHLF project, built using **React.js**. It works in tandem with the backend built with **Java** and **Spring Boot**. The main purpose of this project is to serve as a learning exercise to deepen my understanding of React and frontend development practices. **Please note that this project is not intended to be a fully functional or complete application.**

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Learn and practice React.js for frontend development.
- Understand component-based architecture and state management in React.
- Gain experience in integrating a React frontend with a RESTful API backend.
- Explore the basics of modern frontend development, including routing, forms, and user interactions.

## Features

- Basic user interface for interacting with BKSHLF.
- Integration with the backend for fetching and displaying data.
- Simple routing for navigating between different views/pages.

## Disclaimer

This project is a **work in progress** and will **never be completed**. It is not meant to be a production-ready application or a comprehensive frontend for the Goodreads API. As such, you may find incomplete features, minimal styling, and other limitations.

## Setup

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. Ensure the backend is running to see full functionality.
